**<font size="+1"> A Hands-on Introduction to Radiation Detection: Getting to Know our Radioactive World</font>**

This course is an introduction to basic concepts in radiation detection and radioactivity, electrical circuits, and data analytics. Lectures provide the theoretical foundation of the work being performed in the accompanying laboratory. The course will contain three sections: introduction to how radiation interacts with matter and radiation detection technologies; development of the tools (mathematical and computational) needed for analyzing various types of radiation and environmental data; and building of a basic radiation sensor system.

### [Device Development Task Details](device_project_details.html)
Students will work in groups of two to develop a portion of the sensor data acquisition or calibration. These tasks will require a full understanding of how the chosen sensor works and interfaces with the raspberry pi computer. Each group will have several weeks to complete and test their component and share their work with other groups for interface feedback, ultimately integrating their work with work from other groups to make a fully functioning final device with final project ready data acquisition systems.

### [Final Group Project Details](final_project_details.html)
Students will work in groups of two or three (this can be the same group chosen for your development tasks) to come up with a research project using data collected with their portable radiation and environmental sensor devices, or collected through the larger sensor network these devices are modeled after, to explore a questions related to radiation in our environment.

## Grading Method

The course grade will be based on homework (20%), lab participation (20%), a final project and group presentation (40%), and a final written report (20%).

Work related to group device development projects will make up the majority of the homework grade (80%), including the project related presentations made during the lab sessions. Viewer feedback on presentations and project results will contribute to your lab participation grade. A portion of the final project presentation grade will come from your feedback on other presentations.

## Course Materials

There is a significant amount of programming involved in this course. For this reason, access to a personal laptop that you can bring to class will greatly aid in your progress. That said, if you do not have access to a personal computer, we can make arrangements to provide you with a Raspberry Pi for use during class. Please **contact the instructor prior to the start of the term** if you will not have access to a personal computer during class. 

All other required materials, including electronics and soldering tools, sensor equipment, and any related supplied needed, will be provided in class. You will have the choice to keep the radiation and environmental sensor devices you build in class or to donate them to the [DoseNet](https://radwatch.berkeley.edu/dosenet/map) program for installation in a school, including one of your choosing.
