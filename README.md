**<font size="+3"> A Hands-on Introduction to Radiation Detection: Getting to Know our Radioactive World</font>**

This course is an introduction to basic concepts in radiation detection and radioactivity, electrical circuits, and data analytics. Lectures provide the theoretical foundation of the work being performed in the accompanying laboratory. The course will contain three sections: introduction to how radiation interacts with matter and radiation detection technologies; development of the tools (mathematical and computational) needed for analyzing various types of radiation and environmental data; and building of a basic radiation sensor system.

## Grading Method

The course grade will be based on homework (20%), lab participation (20%), a final project and group presentation (40%), and a final written report (20%).

## Course Materials

There is a significant amount of programming involved in this course. For this reason, access to a personal laptop that you can bring to class will greatly aid in your progress. That said, if you do not have access to a personal computer, we can make arrangements to provide you with a Raspberry Pi for use during class. Please **contact the instructor prior to the start of the term** if you will not have access to a personal computer during class. 

All other required materials, including electronics and soldering tools, sensor equipment, and any related supplied needed, will be provided in class. You will have the choice to keep the radiation and environmental sensor devices you build in class or to donate them to the [DoseNet](https://radwatch.berkeley.edu/dosenet/map) program for installation in a school, including one of your choosing.
