     <h1> Final Projects </h1>
     <div id="mcontent">
        <p>
          You will have the last 2 to 3 weeks to complete your final project.
          Following that period, each group will give a 15 minute presentation
          of their final project results to the class. A final report will be
          due by the end of term.
        </p>

        <p>
          This final project presentation and report is in place of a final
          exam. You will be expected to include elements of the content covered
          in the lectures, and your lab experiences, including technical details
          describing how your detection system acquires data and the associated
          experimental uncertainties, and the correct application of statistical
          methods in the analysis of your data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Potential projects include, but are not limited to, those described
          in the list bellow. You are encouraged to propose your own topics if
          there is something you want to explore that is not listed below. We
          will spend lab time working with each group to provide the input and
          resources, including some of the software, necessary to successfully
          get started with any of the ideas listed, or work with your group to
          ensure you will be able to collect and analyze the necessary data for
          your proposed project.

      <h2> Final Project Suggestions </h2>
      <div id="mcontent">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mapping and identifying sources of background radiation around
            campus. Which areas of campus have higher/lower background levels
            and which sources are contributing to those levels?
          </li>
          <li>
            Identifying the isotopes present and determining the activity of
            unknown sources of radiation. We will supply the sources and ask
            you to determine what radioactive materials it contains and at what
            rate they are producing radiation - the activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exploring environmental factors leading to variations in local
            background radiation rates. This project can in two directions,
            each of which could be done by different teams. The options are:
            <ol>
              <li> Explore large-scale environmental factors using data
                from our radiation sensor network. Are there weather effects
                or other factors (air quality) that correlate with radiation
                levels? </li>
              <li> Explore more localized effects using your portable devices
                - with our portable spectrometers - combining radiation and
                environmental sensor data. Are there correlations between
                CO<sub>2</sub>, etc. and radiation levels locally? What could
                be the explanation for this?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Map out radiation levels in Etcheverry Hall, or other buildings on
            campus, and determine potential causes for any observed significant 
            variation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explore the energy dependence of dose-rate. We calibrate our
            dosimeters using sources that roughly mimic the spectral composition
            we find naturally - is this sufficient? What systematics does this
            introduce to our dose-rate estimate? Could we improve this with a
            different calibration procedure?
          </li>
        </ul>
